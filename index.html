            It’s universal application project, works on any Windows 10
            platform. Server application was written in Java and compatible to
            connect with Android and iOS application. Communication is safe, and
            you can communicate in group or private. For security I created my
            own way, I didn’t use some of the protocols. Communication is
            through sockets, for encryption I was using RSA 2048, 4096 and AES
            128, 256. For hash I used SHA 256 and 512 for cooperation password
            of users in database. Every user has own public and private key. For
            serialization I used JSON. On this application I focus on safety but
            idea is really good too. Client application (XAML C# .NET 4.6,
            Sqlite3 database. Universal project) Server application (Java,
            MySQL) <br />
